# Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

## Description
This project demonstrates a beginner-level machine learning workflow applied to a biomedical dataset.  
The model was trained to classify cancer samples based on biological features using Python and scikit-learn in Google Colab.

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

---

## Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared dataset for model training.  
2. **Model Training:** Trained a Random Forest classifier on biological features.  
3. **Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Results

- **Accuracy:** 96.49% on the test dataset  
- **Precision (average):** 0.97  
- **Recall (average):** 0.96  
- **F1-Score (average):** 0.96  

**Confusion Matrix:**

| Actual \ Predicted | 0 | 1 |
|-------------------|---|---|
| 0                 | 40 | 3 |
| 1                 | 1  | 70 |

The model demonstrates high accuracy in classifying cancer samples, with minimal misclassifications. Full evaluation and analysis are available in the Colab notebook.

## Outcome
- Shows how machine learning can be applied to biological datasets and early cancer detection.  
- Useful for beginners to learn end-to-end ML workflow on real biomedical data.
